SmartSign — Real-Time Sign Language Translator - **SmartSign uses deep learning and computer vision to translate sign language gestures into real-time text and speech for inclusive communication.**


1. **Project goal:** Convert live sign language video to readable text (and optional speech) in near real time.
2. **Start scope:** Begin with isolated-word recognition; later extend to continuous sentence translation.
3. **Collect data:** Gather varied videos (720–1080p, 30–60 FPS) showing torso and hands from multiple signers and backgrounds.
4. **Use public datasets:** Augment with WLASL, ASLLVD and RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather (for continuous) to bootstrap training.
5. **Annotate:** Label clips (word tags) and temporal segments (for continuous) using CVAT or LabelStudio; record signer metadata.
6. **Extract keypoints:** Run MediaPipe (hands + pose + face) to get 2D/3D landmarks per frame and save sequences.
7. **Preprocess & augment:** Normalize by shoulder width, center on torso, smooth temporal jitter; augment with spatial jitter, temporal stretch, and careful horizontal flips.
8. **Design features:** Start with keypoint-only sequences (fast); optionally add hand-crop CNN embeddings for appearance cues.
9. **Choose model:** For isolated use a light temporal model (TCN / Bi-LSTM); for continuous use Transformer encoder + CTC or Seq2Seq with attention.
10. **Loss & metrics:** Use cross-entropy for isolated; CTC or seq2seq cross-entropy for continuous; evaluate with Top-1/Top-5, WER, and signer-independent splits.
11. **Training strategy:** Pretrain CNNs if used, mixed-precision, curriculum from short→long clips, and keep held-out signers for generalization testing.
12. **Realtime inference pipeline:** Camera → MediaPipe → sliding window buffer → feature embedding → model inference → smoothing/temporal voting → overlay text + optional TTS.
13. **Optimize for latency:** Export to ONNX → TensorRT/TFLite/CoreML, apply quantization/pruning, run batch=1 and separate capture/inference threads.
14. **Deploy & UI:** Offer mobile (TFLite), web (TF.js + MediaPipe Web) and desktop/server (ONNX + GPU) options; UI shows captions, confidence, and correction feedback.
15. **Ethics & iteration:** Involve native signers, obtain consent, provide clear accuracy limits, enable human-in-the-loop corrections and periodic retraining with user data.
